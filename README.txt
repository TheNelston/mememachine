IMPORTANT! MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING THIS WITH PYTHON 3, OR ELSE IT WON'T WORK

Here are links on how to install Python 3 on every relevant platform:
OSX: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/
Windows: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/win/

How To Run:

Mac: 
Open up Terminal by looking it up in Spotlight Search, then paste this command into the command line- 
cd Downloads/mememachine-master
Then, paste this command in-
python3 mememachine.py
You're good to go! If you want to re-execute the program, hit the up arrow button once and press enter. If the program is stuck in some loop because you managed to fuck it up, or you just want to prematurely end the program, press Ctrl + C.

Windows:
Open up CMD by locating it using a Windows search tool, then paste this command into the command line-
cd Downloads/mememachine-master
Then, paste this command in-
python3 mememachine.py
You're good to go! If you want to re-execute the program, hit the up arrow button once and press enter. If the program is stuck in some loop because you managed to fuck it up, or you just want to prematurely end the program, press Ctrl + C.

If you have any issues hmu on DM's because this is my fucking baby and I wanna see it work like a charm!
